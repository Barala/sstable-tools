Commands:

HELP              - prints this message
EXIT              - leaves the shell
CREATE TABLE ...  - A CREATE TABLE cql statement to use as metadata when reading sstables (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!)
DESCRIBE SCHEMA   - Show currently used schema (or serialized cfmetadata if generated)
DESCRIBE SSTABLES - Provide details and statistics on current sstable(s)
PAGING [(ON|OFF)] - Enables, disables, or shows current status of query paging.
PAGING <SIZE>     - Enables paging and sets paging size.
SCHEMA <FILE>     - Imports a cql file as the active table schema.
USE               - update the sstable[s] used by default with select, dump, describe commands
    USE /var/lib/cassandra/data/system/peers/ma-1-big-Data.db
    or with multiple sstables separated with spaces. This can also be a directory which will add all sstables in it.
    USE ma-1-big-Data.db ma-2-big-Data.db "/home/path with space/db/data/sstables"

SELECT            - run a cql query against the current sstable (unless other specified)
    SELECT * FROM sstables WHERE key > 1 LIMIT 10
    the keyword sstables will use the current sstable set with the USE command or set when running cqlsh. You can also
    specify an sstable here
    SELECT avg(someColumn) FROM /var/lib/cassandra/data/system/peers/ma-1-big-Data.db WHERE key > 1

DUMP              - dump the raw unfiltered partitions/rows. Useful for debuging TTLed/tombstoned data.
    DUMP;
    Can also specify a where clause for filtering the results.
    DUMP WHERE partitionKey = 'OpsCenter';
